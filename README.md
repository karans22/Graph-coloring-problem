# Graph Coloring Problem
We have been given a graph and we are asked to color all vertices with the ‘M’ number of given colors, in such a way that no two adjacent vertices should have the same color.

It it is possible to color all the vertices with the given colors then we have to output the colored result, otherwise output ‘no solution possible’.

The least possible value of ‘m’ required to color the graph successfully is known as the chromatic number of the given graph.
